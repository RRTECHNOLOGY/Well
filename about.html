    <h2 style="color:white">About Me</h2>
    <p style="color:white" class="parra">
        My name is Hidde de Vries. I work in Sanity's developer relations team. Previously, I worked as a front-end developer and accessibility specialist, with (previous) clients including the Dutch government, W3C and Mozilla.
        
        I am a generalist with over a decade of experience building websites. My focus has been mostly on end users: web accessibility, performance and usability.
        
        For the last five years, more of my work has been about teaching and helping teams. From workshops about accessibility, CSS and design systems to accessibility audits and conference talks.
        
        Background
        I started out studying Artificial Intelligence, but ended up getting a bachelor and masterâ€™s degree in Philosophy. How it relates to front-end work? Abstractions!</p>
